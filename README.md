# SQL-Project - 1
This is my SQL practice project #1 from DataCamp Course.
The project is about finding World's Oldest Businesses from the given dataset.
The project includes selecting columns from a table, filter for rows where they met a criterion, use aggregate functions, determine the order of rows in the result, perform calculations on groups of rows, and filter grouped data. The project also uses inner joins.
